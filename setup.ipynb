    "# What is \"government\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider governemnt to be a complex system that evolves over time. Much like cultures or languages, governments are imaginary systems that drive behavior. They are effemeral emergent systems based on behavior, and I like to consider them entities of their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's prove imposed government is a mathematical impossibility\n",
    "\n",
    "First, start with population of $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say these individuals have interactions with eachother. On average, an individual has $k$ interactions. Let's further say a fraction $m$ of these interactions are meaningful. Then total meaningful interactions can be represented as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I \\approx mkN$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a government to \"exist\" or \"survive\", it must enforce it's \"will\" in the form of laws upon the population. In order to do that, the government must \"monitor\" a number of interactions among the population. Interaction enforcement load $I_E$ describes the necessary information to be processed by a government for it to \"survive\".\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_E = I \\times F = mkN \\times F$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are addressing the viability of governments, so let's consider what we have and how we have been conditioned to think and behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $G$ represent the number of governing agents. Think of these as three letter agencies like DOH, DMV, FBI, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $H$ represent the layers of hierarchy within each agent. Think of this as bureacratic depth. To put one FBI agent in the field requires X amount of support staff. Unfortunately, $G$ and $H$ are not independent variables, $H$ is a function of $G$. The more agents added, the more levels of depth $H$ are needed for them to function. Therefore, $H$ is written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H\\left(G\\right) = H_0 + \\rho G^{\\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $H_0$ is the base level of hierarchy, $G$ is the number of governing agents, $\\rho$ is the coordination overhead and $\\theta$ is a tuneable scaling control factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "How much information can our government process? Let governing capacity $B$ be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B = \\eta G H$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is the information throughput per agent per hierarchy layer, $G$ is the number of governing agents, and $H$ is the bureaucratic depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $B >= I_E$, the government can successfully impose order upon the population. When $B<I_E$, the government is at risk of becoming irrelevant and ignored, and therefore must grow until once again $B>=I_E$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model bureacratic bloat within and betweent governing agents, consider government latency $L$ a funciton of population and hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L\\left(N,H\\right) = \\alpha N^{\\beta}H^{\\gamma},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ represents a base efficiency, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ act as scaling factors to attune the government's sensitivity to a growing population and expanding government.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's remember the government is an intellectual system. It requires individuals to carry out behaviors that maintain it's existence. This comes with a cost of enforcement, $E_C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_C = \\epsilon \\left(k m \\right)^{\\delta} N^{\\zeta},$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ represents a base cost of law enforcement. $kmN$ is the number of meaningful interactions among a population $N$ and $\\delta$ is a complexity scaling factor. $\\zeta$ is a population scaling factor to represent higher costs for monitoring larger populations\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can consider a base enforcement cost of our population.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_E = I_E \\times E_C$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Total cost of governance would then be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_\\text{total} = C_E + L$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each person in that population has a probability of producing an amount of wealth in some form following a log-normal distribution defined by parameters mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P\\left(w_i\\right) \\sim \\text{Log}\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu, \\sigma\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected total weath production is given as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W = \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} w_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Governments then tax this wealth as revenue $R$ at rate $\\tau$ to offset the cost of existence.\n",
    "$$R = \\tau W$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider the fact that governments can use this tax revenue to make improvements for society and the population. This is reflected in higher opportunities for wealth and prosperity for the population, introducing a positive feedback loop of higher and higher wealth. We can model this by redifining our parameter $\\mu$ of the population probability of wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = \\mu_0 + \\lambda\\text{log}\\left(1 + B\\right) - \\psi L$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_0$ is the base economic productivity, $\\lambda$ represents how much value is returned to the people, and $\\psi$ is a latency penalty to simulate delays and bureacracy misfires that offset potential benefits."
